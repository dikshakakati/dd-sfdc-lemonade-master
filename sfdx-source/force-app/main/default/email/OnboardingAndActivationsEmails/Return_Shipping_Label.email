<p>Hey there!<br />
<br />
We just wanted to reach out to let you know that DoorDash/FedEx has sent you an electronic return shipping label at no charge to you. Please print this label and tape it onto a box with the DoorDash owned tablet you will be returning, and drop the package off at your nearest FedEx location. If you have the original box it came in or received a replacement DoorDash owned tablet, you may use that box for shipping. Please ship the tablet within the next 7 business days to avoid potential equipment charges. If you cannot drop off the package, feel free to schedule a pickup with FedEx at your location by calling 1.800.463.3339 or schedule it online at FedEx | <a href="https://www.fedex.com/en-us/shipping/schedule-manage-pickups.html">https://www.fedex.com/en-us/shipping/schedule-manage-pickups.html</a></p>

<p><br />
Please return the products below.</p>
