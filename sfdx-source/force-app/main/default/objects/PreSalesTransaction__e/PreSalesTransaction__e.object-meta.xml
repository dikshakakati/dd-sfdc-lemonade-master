    <description>This event is used to orchestrate the process lifecycle of inbound PreSales transactions.  Generally these are a result of a SSMO transaction payload from Kafka being inserted into the Inbound Ingestion Log object.  
It has it&apos;s own platform event since it is time sensitive and the Mx experience can be impacted by how quickly this process is executed.
It is important that the PreSalesTransaction, PostSalesTransaction, and Instant_Ingestor event objects all have the same field shape.
